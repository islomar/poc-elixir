## Getting started
- Year 2022: using Elixir 1.12.3 (current version in December 2025: 1.19.4)
- `git clone https://github.com/pragdave/e4p2-hangman.git`
- The **OTP framework** is a sophisticated way of managing large (and small) scale deployments of applications containing thousands of modules and millions of processes.
  - OTP **(Open Telecom Platform)** is a set of libraries that ships with Erlang
- **hex** is the Elixir package repository. It maintains a repository of Elixir and Erlang packages (at [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/)).
- [**mix**](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html): a project configuration management build tool
- [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html) is a unit-test based framework that ships with Elixir.
- **iex**: the Elixir REPL
  - `h IO` (help for IO module)
  - `IO.puts "Hello world!"`: puts for "put string"
  - `clear`
  - `h IO.puts`
  - `v(9)`: give me the value of expression number 9
  - `v(-1)`: give me the value of the last expression
  - `#iex:break`: stop execution
  - You can customize some aspects of IEx by writing code into a file called `.iex.exs`: [example](./.iex.exs.pragdave)
    - "IEx looks for .iex.exs in the current directory and then in your home directory. My configuration above sits in my home directory, so it applies to all IEx sessions."
    - `chardata_to_string` converts a list of strings into a single string.
    - "The colors in the .iex.exs file are written as :cyan, :light_magenta, :yellow, and so on. These values (which Elixir calls atoms) are interpreted inside IEx using calls to IO.ANSI format."
    - https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.ANSI.html
    - "The colors in the default prompt section use the 8-bit color extension for ANSI X3.64 escape sequences, which are honored by just about all terminal programs (although you may have to enable them using the registry in Windows)."

## Our first project
- In Elixir, a **"project"** = **"application"** = **"component"**
- Sometimes an Elixir application is what you might call a **library**
- Hangman game:
  - **Dictionary** application/component
  - **Logic** application/component
  - **UI** applications/components (CLI, GUI)
- `mix new hangman`
  - the production code goes under `lib/`
  - the file `mix.exs` defines the configuration of your project
- `mix test`
- `mix`: compile the application
- All the functions must be inside **modules* (`defmodule`)
- `mix run` does nothing if there is no proper entrypoint
- `mix run -e Dictionary.hello`: `-e` for `execute`. It executes the `hello` function inside the `Dictionary` module.
- `iex -S mix`: it runs iex with mix, which has the knowledge about our application, modules, functions, etc.
- From inside `iex`, in order to reload a module, there are two options:
  - `r Dictionar`: recompile Dictionary. Advantage: it allows autocompletion
  - `c "lib/dictionary.ex"`: compile this file
- **Module names** must be an Elixir atom. 
  - Conventionally we use Capitalized words (MyFirstModule).
- **Function names** are either names or one of the Elixir operators. 
  - Names must start with a lowercase letter or underscore, and may contain letters, digits, and underscores. 
  - The name may end with an exclamation point or a question mark.
- From Erlang: any collection of bytes is a `binary` (strings didn't make much sense in Erlang)
  - In Elixir, most `binary` data will be strings...
- In Erlang/Elixir, the identification of a function consists in two parts: its name and the number of parameters it takes (arity)
  - name / arity, e.g. `split/1`, `split/2`
- Often Elixir has two variants of a function, such as `File.read` and `File.read!` 
  - Most of the time this means that the plain version will return an error status on failure, and the version with the shriek will raise an exception. 
  - This rule isn't universal, though, so check the documentation.
- `String.codepoints(my_string)`: Split a string into a list of characters, where each entry in the list is a single character string.
- `String.myers_difference(my_string_1, my_string_2)`calculate the set of differences between two strings
- As a font, he uses "Fira Code"
- **Functional Composition**
  - Composition means chaining together functions so that the output of one becomes the input of the next.
  - `|> a_function`: functional style, it will pass the output of the previous line as a first parameter to this function
- **Module attributes**: they start with `@`
  - Created and executed at compile time.
